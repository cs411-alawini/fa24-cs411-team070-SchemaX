## Project Summary
The goal of the Digital Food Donation Matching System is to prevent the amount of food prepared or stored from being wasted. It is a digital food donation management system; a platform to facilitate the exchange of commodities between people who have excess or surplus cooked/raw/stored/prepared food and people who need food like charities, food banks, and community centers in need or individuals. The platform is a central place that helps to ensure that food reaches the people who need it most and that none goes to waste.

This application will allow donors like restaurants, stores, individuals, etc. to create profiles and list all the types and quantities of food they want to donate along with their preferred pick-up timings. That concludes the fundamentals of the donor side. On the consumer side, charities, food banks, and individuals can create profiles and then select filters to look for the type of food they want. They will also be able to set preferences for the types of food they need and their current needs to receive notifications. 

The platform will include a database of non-profit organizations and food banks along with the details of a list of donated items. Additionally, the application will also incorporate a cloud-based notification system to ensure that all the donors and recipients get real-time updates. Moreover, the donors will be able to track the status of their donations and look at the live dashboard of their donations.
